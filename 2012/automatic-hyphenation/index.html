        	<h3>Rea&shy;sons for full&nbsp;jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion</h3>

	<p>Some weeks ago I began to play around with full jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion of texts be&shy;yond <span style="font-family: cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, Times, serif; letter-spacing: 0.075em;">L<span style="text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 70%; margin-left: -0.36em; vertical-align: 0.3em; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.15em;">a</span>T<span style="text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -0.1667em; vertical-align: -0.5ex; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.125em;">e</span>X</span>. Fully jus&shy;ti&shy;fied texts are used by pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al type&shy;set&shy;ters and they can be found in al&shy;most every news&shy;pa&shy;per. Full jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion is nec&shy;es&shy;sary there, be&shy;cause oth&shy;er&shy;wise the read&shy;er would loose the ori&shy;en&shy;ta&shy;tion be&shy;tween all the small col&shy;umns. They also ap&shy;pear more and more in the In&shy;ter&shy;net as it just looks more pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al and is far eas&shy;i&shy;er to read, in par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar when the para&shy;graph widths are small. This is the case on mo&shy;bile de&shy;vices and in multi-col&shy;umn-lay&shy;outs using <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span>5.</p>

	<h3>Re&shy;spon&shy;sive&nbsp;De&shy;sign</h3>

	<p>There&#8217;s an im&shy;por&shy;tant link to Re&shy;spon&shy;sive Web&shy;de&shy;sign as the jus&shy;ti&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion de&shy;pends es&shy;sen&shy;tial&shy;ly on the dis&shy;play-width. If a fully jus&shy;ti&shy;fied para&shy;graph is hy&shy;phened with the usual hy&shy;phen <code>-</code>, it works only for a spe&shy;cif&shy;ic text/box-width and usu&shy;al&shy;ly fails with slight&shy;ly changed ren&shy;der&shy;ing con&shy;di&shy;tions. Not only in Re&shy;spon&shy;sive De&shy;sign, it is ex&shy;pect&shy;ed that all texts are scal&shy;ing prop&shy;er&shy;ly and are dis&shy;played in a read&shy;able and con&shy;sis&shy;tent fash&shy;ion, so a &#8220;hard hy&shy;phen&#8221; <code>-</code> is a very bad&nbsp;idea.</p>

	<p>Some time ago a found a web&shy;site of a pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al mar&shy;ket&shy;ing group which had a short (fully jus&shy;ti&shy;fied) para&shy;graph at the top of their home&shy;page. But they used just a nor&shy;mal hy&shy;phen <code>-</code>, which re&shy;sults in ugly white spaces be&shy;tween the words when zoom&shy;ing in/out. This is of course not a good way to cre&shy;ate jus&shy;ti&shy;fied para&shy;graphs and can re&shy;sult in a bad&nbsp;im&shy;pres&shy;sion!</p>

	<h3>Ty&shy;pog&shy;ra&shy;phy</h3>

	<p>Above I men&shy;tioned al&shy;ready <span style="font-family: cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, Times, serif; letter-spacing: 0.075em;">T<span style="text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -0.1667em; vertical-align: -0.5ex; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.125em;">e</span>X</span>, which has a great (maybe the best?) hy&shy;phen&shy;ation al&shy;go&shy;rithm. Any&shy;way, it&#8217;s the best open one ;-). This al&shy;go&shy;rithm uses syl&shy;la&shy;ble di&shy;vi&shy;sion based on lan&shy;guage-spe&shy;cif&shy;ic pat&shy;terns. Of course there exist many ex&shy;cep&shy;tions to this com&shy;mon rules, but the <span style="font-family: cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, Times, serif; letter-spacing: 0.075em;">T<span style="text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -0.1667em; vertical-align: -0.5ex; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.125em;">e</span>X</span>-al&shy;go&shy;rithm is very well-en&shy;gi&shy;neered and fails very rarely under spe&shy;cial and un&shy;pre&shy;dictable cases (in these cases you can help <span style="font-family: cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, Times, serif; letter-spacing: 0.075em;">T<span style="text-transform: uppercase; margin-left: -0.1667em; vertical-align: -0.5ex; line-height: 0; margin-right: -0.125em;">e</span>X</span> by adding your own&nbsp;rules).</p>

	<p>A sim&shy;ple hy&shy;phen&shy;ation al&shy;go&shy;rithm with pat&shy;tern-de&shy;tec&shy;tion can be eas&shy;i&shy;ly im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed, but I only want per&shy;fect so&shy;lu&shy;tions. So, pro&shy;fes&shy;sion&shy;al set&shy;ting pro&shy;grams have their (good) so&shy;lu&shy;tions and take their time to process all the data. So what are the so&shy;lu&shy;tions for the&nbsp;web?</p>

	<h3>So&shy;lu&shy;tions for the&nbsp;Web</h3>

	<p>The prob&shy;lem is that most Brows&shy;er don&#8217;t have syl&shy;la&shy;ble di&shy;vi&shy;sion al&shy;go&shy;rithms im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed, so the de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ers and web de&shy;sign&shy;ers have to take care about this issue. There exist sev&shy;er&shy;al so&shy;lu&shy;tions which en&shy;able au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;ic hy&shy;phen&shy;ation on the web. Some are im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed in JavaScript, which gen&shy;er&shy;ate the hy&shy;phen&shy;ation at run-/ren&shy;der-time in the brows&shy;er. In my opin&shy;ion this is the worst idea to solve this prob&shy;lem, as JavaScript is re&shy;quired and the hy&shy;phen&shy;ation is done for every ren&shy;dering and every client (re&shy;sult&shy;ing in longer ren&shy;dering times), thus it is more in&shy;ef&shy;fi&shy;cient than other&nbsp;so&shy;lu&shy;tions.</p>

	<p>Oth&shy;ers gen&shy;er&shy;ate the so-called &#8220;soft-hy&shy;phens&#8221; at run- or com&shy;pile-time (on the serv&shy;er by a <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CGI</span></span>-lan&shy;guage or lo&shy;cal&shy;ly by sta&shy;t&shy;ic com&shy;pil&shy;ers), which are em&shy;bed&shy;ded in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span>-source&shy;code by the <code>&amp;shy;</code>-code. These <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span>-Codes are hints for the brows&shy;er and sig&shy;nal them the pos&shy;si&shy;ble syl&shy;la&shy;ble di&shy;vi&shy;sions. The Brows&shy;er then knows where an in-word break is pos&shy;si&shy;ble and jus&shy;ti&shy;fies the para&shy;graph per&shy;fect&shy;ly de&shy;pend&shy;ing on the block width. This method is used by <a href="/projects/#acrylamid">acry&shy;lamid</a> via a fil&shy;ter and there&shy;fore also en&shy;abled on this home&shy;page. It is the best method for the time being, be&shy;cause it is sup&shy;port&shy;ed by all browsers! The only down&shy;side of the soft hy&shy;phens is, that the text is quite un&shy;read&shy;able in the source code (se&shy;man&shy;tic ex&shy;pres&shy;sions are of course not&nbsp;af&shy;fect&shy;ed).</p>

	<h4><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span>3</h4>

	<p>The best news is an up&shy;com&shy;ing fea&shy;ture of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span>3, called <code>hyphens</code>. It en&shy;ables au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;ic hy&shy;phen&shy;ation al&shy;go&shy;rithms in the brows&shy;ers, so that they can fi&shy;nal&shy;ly do the work they have to do: dis&shy;play con&shy;tent prop&shy;er&shy;ly. The fea&shy;ture is yet not fully im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed in every brows&shy;er, so that brows&shy;er-spe&shy;cif&shy;ic prop&shy;er&shy;ties have to be used. Ad&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly the brows&shy;ers may not sup&shy;port all lan&shy;guages&nbsp;yet.</p>

<pre><code>body {
  -moz-hyphens: auto;
  -ms-hyphens: auto;
  -o-hyphens: auto;
  -webkit-hyphens: auto;
  hyphens: auto;
}
</code></pre>

	<p>At the time being, the fea&shy;ture is not at all re&shy;li&shy;ably im&shy;ple&shy;ment&shy;ed! The best way re&shy;mains adding soft hy&shy;phens until every brows&shy;er has a good hy&shy;phen&shy;ation al&shy;go&shy;rithm. Nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less I added this code to my stylesheet, maybe it is help&shy;ful for some&nbsp;ren&shy;der&shy;ings.</p>

	<p>The cur&shy;rent state of art can be test&shy;ed on a pri&shy;vate <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/css/tests/css3/show.php?p=hyphens">test-page</a>. The spec&shy;i&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion is &#8211; as usual &#8211; at W3.org in the sec&shy;tion <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span> Text Level 3</a>.</p>
