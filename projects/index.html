        	<h2>pho&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;phy and&nbsp;videog&shy;ra&shy;phy</h2>

	<p>Since 2009 I&#8217;m ac&shy;com&shy;pa&shy;ny&shy;ing pub&shy;lic events of my mean&shy;while for&shy;mer school <a href="http://www.bgamstetten.ac.at/"><span class="caps">BG</span>/<span class="caps">BRG</span> Am&shy;stet&shy;ten</a>. After the foun&shy;da&shy;tion of the so&shy;ci&shy;ety of grad&shy;u&shy;ates and friends of the <span class="caps">BG</span>/<span class="caps">BRG</span> Am&shy;stet&shy;ten, the <a href="http://absolventenverein.ostarrichi-gymnasium.at/">Ab&shy;sol&shy;ven&shy;ten&shy;vere&shy;in</a> in 2012 I also start&shy;ed to doc&shy;u&shy;ment these&nbsp;events.</p>

	<p>Apart from this I&#8217;m also doing panora&shy;mas, Pseu&shy;do-<span class="caps"><span class="caps">HDR</span></span>s and bulb ex&shy;po&shy;sures, yet only for pri&shy;vate&nbsp;pur&shy;pose.</p>

	<p>At the end of 2014 I also start&shy;ed with videog&shy;ra&shy;phy in co&shy;op&shy;er&shy;a&shy;tion with <a href="//www.davidblacher.at">david&shy;blach&shy;er.at</a>.</p>

	<p>The soft&shy;ware I&#8217;m using in post-pro&shy;duc&shy;tion are <a href="http://www.darktable.org/">Dark&shy;table</a>, <a href="http://hugin.sourceforge.net/">Hugin</a> and <a href="http://qtpfsgui.sourceforge.net/">Lu&shy;mi&shy;nance <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HDR</span></span></a>, all of them are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free soft&shy;ware</a>.</p>

	<h2>serv&shy;er&nbsp;ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion</h2>

	<p>Since 2011 I&#8217;m main&shy;tain&shy;ing my own serv&shy;er with web and mail ser&shy;vices for me and some friends.<br />
Some of my per&shy;son&shy;al goals is to come in touch with the cur&shy;rent tech&shy;niques, stan&shy;dards and soft&shy;ware, get&shy;ting a grasp of &#8220;how the in&shy;ter&shy;net works&#8221;, and sub&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly to de&shy;cen&shy;tral&shy;ize the web by using more in&shy;de&shy;pen&shy;dent&nbsp;ser&shy;vices.</p>

	<p>My per&shy;son&shy;al focus lies on <a href="http://postfix.org/">Post&shy;fix</a> and <a href="https://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a>.</p>

	<p>A pro&shy;ject I am par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pat&shy;ing in and re&shy;lat&shy;ed to serv&shy;er ad&shy;min&shy;is&shy;tra&shy;tion is <a href="bettercrypto.org">bet&shy;ter&shy;cryp&shy;to.org</a>. The goal of this pro&shy;ject is to raise the usage of strong cryp&shy;tog&shy;ra&shy;phy where pos&shy;si&shy;ble by pro&shy;vid&shy;ing ready-to-use con&shy;fig&shy;u&shy;ra&shy;tion snip&shy;pets for serv&shy;er&nbsp;soft&shy;ware.</p>

	<h2>Lin&shy;ux&shy;wochen&nbsp;Vi&shy;en&shy;na</h2>

	<p>Be&shy;gin&shy;ning in 2014 I en&shy;gaged in the or&shy;ga&shy;ni&shy;za&shy;tion team of the Vi&shy;en&shy;nese con&shy;fer&shy;ence <a href="http://linuxwochen.at/">Lin&shy;ux&shy;wochen Wien</a> and am now a core mem&shy;ber. I also gave work&shy;shops for Hugin and&nbsp;dark&shy;table.</p>

	<p><a href="/img/fba-title.png"><img src="/img/fba-title.png" style="float:left; width: 100px"/></a> Until late Feb&shy;ru&shy;ary 2012 I was oc&shy;cu&shy;pied in writ&shy;ing and fin&shy;ish&shy;ing a work called &#8220;Fach&shy;bere&shy;ich&shy;sar&shy;beit&#8221; for my gram&shy;mar school grad&shy;u&shy;a&shy;tion. My the&shy;sis has to do with cur&shy;rent de&shy;vel&shy;op&shy;ments and the&shy;ses in the de&shy;bate of the ac&shy;cel&shy;er&shy;at&shy;ing ex&shy;pan&shy;sion of the uni&shy;verse and the&shy;o&shy;ries deal&shy;ing with these top&shy;ics. It gives also an overview on the his&shy;to&shy;ry of all the ob&shy;ser&shy;va&shy;tions and dis&shy;cus&shy;sions that led us to the state of&nbsp;play.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://github.com/sebix/Unity-Opera">Unity-Opera</a> <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">Python</span></h2>

	<p>Unity-Opera is a small Python-Script that adds Unity in&shy;te&shy;gra&shy;tion to the Opera Web brows&shy;er.<br />
Unity is the new Desk&shy;top en&shy;vi&shy;ron&shy;ment of the very pop&shy;u&shy;lar Linux dis&shy;tri&shy;b&shy;u&shy;tion&nbsp;Ubun&shy;tu.</p>

	<p>Since I&#8217;m using Gnome2/3 in&shy;stead of Unity I stopped work&shy;ing on it, but nev&shy;er&shy;the&shy;less the script be&shy;haves well with cur&shy;rent ver&shy;sions of&nbsp;Unity.</p>

	<h2>some&nbsp;gists</h2>

	<p>Small and un&shy;re&shy;mark&shy;able pro&shy;grams that de&shy;serve more&nbsp;usage!</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/1181355">Ja&shy;men&shy;do-Down&shy;loader</a> <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">Bash</span></h3>

	<p>This small Shell-Script can help you in en&shy;larg&shy;ing your music reper&shy;toire! Just pass a tag (e.g. your fa&shy;vorite genre), the album or an&shy;oth&shy;er list of music tracks or al&shy;bums to the script and let them down&shy;load in <span class="caps"><span class="caps">OGG</span></span> or <span class="caps">MP3</span>.  It uses the <a href="http://developer.jamendo.com/en/wiki/Musiclist2Api">of&shy;fi&shy;cial <span class="caps"><span class="caps">API</span></span></a> of <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/">Ja&shy;men&shy;do</a>.</p>

	<h3><a href="https://gist.github.com/1086477">Batch-test your pro&shy;grams</a> <span style="float:right; font-size:0.8em">Bash</span></h3>

	<p>This script ex&shy;e&shy;cutes one given pro&shy;gram with a bunch of input files and com&shy;pares the out&shy;put with the so&shy;lu&shy;tion-files (if given). Very use&shy;ful when train&shy;ing for the <a href="http://ioinformatics.org/index.shtml">Olympiad in In&shy;for&shy;mat&shy;ics</a>, which pro&shy;vides huge test data for every&nbsp;prob&shy;lem.</p>
